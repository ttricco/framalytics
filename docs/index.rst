Framalytics Documentation
=========================

`Framalytics <https://github.com/ttricco/framalytics>`_ is a Python package to work with FRAMs.

The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is a method for mapping processes. FRAM is a function-based
approach that is used to understand interactions between functions and identify performance variability.
Framalytics brings FRAM to the rich data science and machine learning ecosystem in Python. Framalytics can
read the native .xfmv file format from the `FRAM Model Visualizer (FMV)
<https://functionalresonance.com/the%20fram%20model%20visualiser/>`_, and can render a FRAM model using
Matplotlib, incorporate real data together with a FRAM model, and provides a general API for
interacting with a FRAM.
