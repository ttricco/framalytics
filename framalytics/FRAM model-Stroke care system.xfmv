      <Description>The role of an advanced care paramedic in stroke care is to recognize and identify patients who might be suffering from a stroke and then to appropriately manage their initial treatments such as getting EVs, if there is any initial resuscitation that needs to happen. 
We conduct a a simple fast exam. If their fast exam was positive, then we would move on to the race score, if they met that criteria. 
We assess patients based on basic signs and symptoms of a stroke, such as neurological complaints, weakness, difficulty speaking, decreased level of consciousness, and so on.

Neurologists take care of all the neurology patients in hospital, which includes all of the patients admitted with stroke. They work with the stroke team, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, clinical nutritionists, and social workers.
Neurologists check patients' blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes to optimize their medication. 
Neurologists assess patients when they are admitted into emergency department. Based on the results of the CT scan, some patients would be eligible for TNK and some would be eligible for EVT. Sometimes the patient may get both, so they may get TNK and then go for EVT.
 Patients will be admitted to acute care neurology ward or the ICU if they're quite unwell.
Patients can skip the ICU and go to the inpatient/stroke unit if they don't receive tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). If patients are not a candidate for that drug and if they don't need to be closely monitored, so they don't go to ICU necessarily.
They have access to patients' past medical history, including medication, blood work, and diagnostic imaging. 
Patients who received treatment (TNK, TPA, or EVT) must repeat their CT scan when they are in stroke unit. It is done to make sure they are well.</Description>

      <Description>Stroke patients would either enter the emergency department via a direct admission from another site, or via ambulance, or family caregiver. Patients are assigned to a neurologist if they are transferred to emrgency department via ambulance. Otherwise, they are assigned to either an emergency physician or a nurse practitioner. 
The most common way is the code stroke is called by the paramedics and the first assessment done in the ED is by the neurology resident and subsequently the neurologist. If neurologists determine that there is no stroke, then neurologists hand them over to the ED physicians and they do their assessment.
Patients may be directly transferred to stroke unit based on urgency, priority, and bed capacity if they are admitted with stroke from other hospitals. These patients already have the CT scan. 
Patients' MCP number must be delivered to triage or registeration desk. Then, a neurologist is paged through paging system to visit a new patient.</Description>

Emergency department: Emergency physicions or emergency nurses usually arrange for a CT scan after neurological assessment for a potiential stroke patient. 
Inpatient/stroke unit: Neurologists, nurse practitioners, residents arrange for a repeat scan after 24 to 48 hours to map the extent of the stroke that patients had.
Once the patient arrives in medical imaging department, they go immediately to CT, they have their CTA and Angio. The radiologist meets them there in the department. 
The results of a CT scan would be either stroke, no stroke, or bleeding. If it is stroke, the patient must go to the angio suite to remove the clot from their brain. If it is not stroke, they must go back to the emergency department. If it is bleeding, the patient must be transferred to neurosurgery ward.</Description>

      <Description>Intensive care unit (ICU)

If patients are quite unwell, they are admitted to ICU from the emergency department. Patients usually spend the first 24 hours in ICU before they are admitted to the inpatient/stroke unit (or acute care unit). They should be monitored because they need frequent checks with their neural vital signs. Their heart rhythm and blood pressure are monitored closely. 
Not all patients are admitted to ICU. Patients who received treatment (TNK, TPA, or EVT) need to be monitored. So, they are transferred to ICU. Patients who received treatment must repeat their CT scan when they are in ICU. If they are well/safe to move, they can go to the stroke unit. This is a collaborative decision between ICU doctors and the neurology team. If they are unwell, they must stay in ICU longer.
Patients may stay in ICU for longer than 24 hours because there's no bed on the neurology floor, so they end up staying in ICU for 2,3,4 days waiting for a bed.
We would require manpower, the angio suite availability, two interventional radiologists and anesthesia and anesthesia assistant. 
The circulating nurse would give report to the ICU nurse who was in taking that patient. So it would be a verbal report. We would hand over our documentation, our special procedure record.</Description>

      <IDName>Discharge the patient</IDName>
      <Description>The multidisciplinary team decides to discharge patients based on their functioning ability. If they are are functioning well or even if they have mild deficits, they are discharged from hospital.
Patients are discharged from hospital based on their alpha FIM score.  The multidisiplinary team calculates the score and determines where patients should go. The Alpha FIM score is calculated three times: admission day (in stroke unit), day 3, and day 7.  If it's really good on day three, then discharge planning should start. If there is room for improvement, they look at the day seven score and that's when discharge planning should start.
If there is a moderate to severe deficit, patients cannot go home right away. They need rehabilitation.
I guess on discharge, the patient will go home with a discharge summary from their whoever their provider is, whatever neurologists they're admitted under, and then the family doctor or nurse practitioner nowadays would monitor the patient and make sure that if they needed to be on Plavix or aspirin or other appropriate blood thinners, that they were continued for the appropriate level of time. 
If the symptoms are severe and rehabilitation doesn't work and patients are not able to be looked after at home, then they would either require, a personal care home or long term care depending on the family situation and the patients care needs.</Description>

Clients/patients who have a little bit of discharge barriers, but if they made some gains in mobility or cognition, they could then return to their pre admission location.
If patients are not appropriate for the Miller Center and cannot go home. Then social workers will do an assessment for care. So they go to a personal care home as a level one or two.
If somebody is going to a personal care home, they need to be assigned a case manager.
If patients' functioning ability increases in a personal care home, they may go home. They can either return home with home supports or they can return home with no supports if they don't have any care needs. If their functional ability decreases in the personal care home, they stay in the personal care home or they should go to a long-term care facility.</Description>

I monitor them until they're more prepared to go. 
I coordinate and arrange family meetings for any patient who is going to be a more complex discharge. The purpose of this is to bring the patient and their families together to help determine the path for discharge.

Dietitians review stroke patients' charts and follow up with speech language pathologists before they calculate patients' nutrition needs.
If dietitians' assessment shows that there is weight loss, they meet with the patient and provide them with supplements to increase the nutrition to get some weight back. If dietitians' assessment shows that patients don't need much intervention, dietitians don't see them at all until they are being discharged. In this scenario, patients are provided with education. 
Patients sometimes get discharged without being seen by dietitians due to the shortcomings of dietitians.</Description>

They do a neurological physiotherapy exam with the patient that would include assessing their range of motion, their strength, eventually their balanced ambulation.
Initial assessment (getting patients' past history, including how they were preadmission, what their baseline is for mobility, and their social history) is done once, but reassessment would be done constantly. Formal assessment is done once at the end of their journey before getting discharged from the stroke unit.
They assess patients' physical ability to make sure they are a candidate for rehabilitation. They are involved in calculating alpha FIM score for each patient. 
Physiotherapists can track patients and their referrals online via a Cognos system.  It's an online system that tries to capture the different units of the hospital.
Canadian stroke best practices have different sections. Physiotherapists follow sections that highlight guidelines for stroke patient assessment. Patients must be assessed by an allied health member within 72 hours after they are admitted to stroke unit.</Description>

Occupational therapists work with all patients in the neurology unit, including stroke patients, neural patients, and medicine patients.
Occupational therapists do initial assessments with physiotherapy or an assistant. They need to chat with the medical team, look at patients' charts on Meditech to obtain some information before they actually go and see patients. 
Occupational therapists also do overall assessments with physiotherapists. It includes a functional assessment. They look at all patients' activities of daily living, their transfer status, their cognitive and perceptual abilities, and their upper extremity.
Occupational therapists also do a comprehensive assessment on pressure management with physiotherapists. 
Families are sources of information for Occupational and physio therapists, if patients are cognitively impaired, and if they are too drowsy to participate in the subjective portion of the of the assessment.</Description>

      <Description>Social workers do home care assessment in hospital (about an hour). And from that assessment they gather just information about the person's physical functioning, what their home looks like.  Then occupational therapy is involved because equipment is a huge piece. And the occupational therapist will take care of prescribing the equipment and send them home. 
Social worker looks at the clients care needs if they have adequate supports when they go home. So I'll facilitate home supports and I do the assessments for that. Clients will either go home with home supports to the home supports program with Eastern Health or they will go home. Some will opt to private pay. So in those instances I'd give them a list of agencies and they would opt to private pay and would just pay per hour if they're not appropriate to go home. 
If patients are going to go home with supports, they are assigned a case manager, so I will send a referral. Just simply an e-mail off to a consult. A general e-mail for community intake, and I'll notify them that this client is going home. They're going home under home supports and they need a case manager.</Description>

      <Description>Anybody who is admitted with a stroke, we have our protocol that the stroke multi-disciplinary team (or allied health team) sees them.
The stroke multi-disciplinary team (PT, OT, SLP, social worker, and dietition) and medical team (neurologists, residents, and nurse practitioners) take part in daily rounds. The team gets patients' information every morning. Then the team is able to keep track of how patients are progressing. Then they are also able to keep track of new patients.
Neurologists get the input from everyone and tell the team about patients: what past medical history they have, how they are being treated, what is left to be treated, and are they medically still active.
The stroke team gets referrals in daily/morning rounds in addition to the Meditech System. Some patients are in the Emergeency Department that have not necessarily been entered in the Meditech system yet. The stroke team gets referrals regarding these patients in morning rounds.
The team discusses what the next step would be for patients with "well functioning" or "mild deficit". The team can discharge these patients. They determine patients' priority and what kind of goals to set for their stay, discharge, and rehabilitation potential. 
The multidisciplinary team decides to discharge patients based on their functioning ability. If they are are functioning well or even if they have mild deficits, they are discharged from hospital.
Stroke (or allied health) team members do a note daily on Meditech regarding each patient. They do face to face conversations with the medical/neurology team, which includes the nurse practitioner, residents, and neurologists (neurologists are not always available for face to face conversations). It's typically run by the neurology residents and nurse practitioners. And then we discuss patients’ progress every day in team rounds.</Description>

      <Description>Inpatient unit=stroke unit=acute care unit. Stroke unit is situated in neurology unit.
Patients admitted to stroke unit would be seen by medical team (either neurologists, residents, or nurse practitioners).
Patients can be admitted from the emergency department and would go to the inpatient/stroke unit if they don't receive treatment like tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). If patients are not a candidate for that drug, they don't need to be closely monitored so they don't go to ICU necessarily. 
Patients can also be admitted from the intensive care unit (ICU). They would go to the emergency department first, then they have kind of a stopover in ICU before getting into the inpatient unit.</Description>
